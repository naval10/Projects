You will perform the following tasks:-    

- Provision the environments  <== THIS STAGE    
- Setup AWS Managed Instances  
- Setup On-Prem Managed instances

A Jumpbox running in both.  

# STAGE 1A - Login to an AWS Account      
Login to an AWS account and select the `N. Virginia // us-east-1 region`    

# STAGE 1B - APPLY CloudFormation (CFN) Stack  

Before applying the stack below, make sure you have a SSH Keypair created and you have the .pem part downloaded to your local machine  
https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=us-east-1#KeyPairs:  

If you **DON'T** then you need to create one called `A4L` (Animals4life - the case study used in these demos)  

Click `Create Key pair`  
under Name enter `A4L`  
For file format select `pem` (if you use windows and putty you can pick `ppk`, if you run windows and any WSL2 or other terminal apps which use standard eys pick `pem`)  
Click `Create Key Pair`  
it will download the `.pem` file to your local machine, keep this safe and in the same folder as you run any commands later.  

Click https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1#/stacks/quickcreate?templateURL=https://learn-cantrill-labs.s3.amazonaws.com/aws-patch-manager/PatchManagerBase.yaml&stackName=SSMBASE

Click https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1#/stacks/quickcreate?templateURL=https://learn-cantrill-labs.s3.amazonaws.com/aws-patch-manager/PatchManagerVPCEndpointsandRole.yaml&stackName=SSMVPCE  
Check the box for `capabilities: [AWS::IAM::Role]`  
Click `Create Stack`  
Wait for the `SSMVPCE` template to move into a `CREATE_COMPLETE` status
